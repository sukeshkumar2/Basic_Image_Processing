    By the end of the project, you'd have created and trained a Neural Network model that, after the training, will be able to predict digits from hand-written images with a high degree of accuracy and along the way, you'd have developed a basic understanding of how Neural Networks work and you'd have developed a basic understanding of TensorFlow syntax with Keras as its front end.
    
    

We are going to use the popular MNIST dataset which has lots of images of hand-written digits along with their labels.
